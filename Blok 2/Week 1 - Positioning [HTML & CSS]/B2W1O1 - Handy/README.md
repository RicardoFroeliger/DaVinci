# B1W1O1 - Handy
## Created by Ricardo Froeliger

Da Vinci is going to expand.<br>
From next week they will start with their 'convenient construction service'.<br>
Therefore they would like to have a beautiful website with the latest techniques, positioning and hover effects.<br>
They hired a web designer and he came up with the attached design.<br>
Your job is to build this design in HTML and CSS as best you can.<br>

Since they don't quite know yet what they want on the website, you are going to create two pages: the 'Home' page and the 'Services' page.<br>
The copywriter has already added the texts for I in text.txt.<br>
The webdesigner has also been kind enough to put together the colors for you.<br>
You can find this in colorinformation.txt.
