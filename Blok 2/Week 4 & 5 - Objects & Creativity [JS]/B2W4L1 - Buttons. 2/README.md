# B2W4L1 - Buttons. 2
## Created by Ricardo Froeliger

Use B2W2L1 - Buttons. 1 and make the following extension:

The button that you clicked last will have the background color changed to red and you can no longer click on this button for 1 round.<br>
The button DOES remain visible on your page.

Example:<br> 
All buttons have the value 0 at the beginning.<br> 
You click on button 2.<br>
The value of button 2 is increased by 1, the background color gets red and you can no longer click on it.<br> 
Button 1 and button 3 remain green and you can still click on them.<br>

This process continues continuously.

Summary:<br>
The last button pressed is increased in value and blocked in the next 'click round' (the red background color makes this visible).<br>
The other two buttons are green and you can click on them.
