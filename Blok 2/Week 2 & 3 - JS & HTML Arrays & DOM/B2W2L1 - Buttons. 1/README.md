# B2W2L1 - Buttons. 1
## Created by Ricardo Froeliger

Create a container in an html page (dimensions 600px by 600px) and add to this container:
* 3 html buttons (each with its own ID)
* 1 image (with an id) and you can use 0.jpg as default value

With JS and CSS, make sure the application does the following:
* The background image of the container changes continuously with the clicking of the buttons
* The image in the html changes continuously with the clicking of the buttons
* Every time a button is clicked the value increases by 1 (all buttons have a starting value of 0)
* The background image and image match with the buttons that have been clicked: button1, button2 or button3
