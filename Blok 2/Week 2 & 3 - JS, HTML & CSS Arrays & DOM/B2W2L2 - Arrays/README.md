# B2W2L2 - Arrays
## Created by Ricardo Froeliger

### Exercise 1 
Create an array containing the days of the week: Monday to Sunday.<br>
The following output shows you on your screen where you have to use the 'address' of the array with the days you have created.


Header h2 "All days of the week are:"
On the screen you see as text: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

Header h2 "The buisiness days are:"
On the screen you see as text: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.

Header h2 "The weekends are:"
On the screen you see as text: Saturday, Sunday.

**And these 3 reversed aswell**


### Exercise 2
You create the following 2 arrays:

var arrayOne = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];
var arrayTwo = [2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18.20];  

In your solution you create 4 functions that perform the calculations and write the output to the screen:
* addition (arrayOne, arrayTwo);
* subtract (arrayTwo, arrayOne);
* multiply (arrayOne, arrayTwo);
* divide (arrayTwo, arrayOne);


### Exercise 3  
Create an array containing the following multiplication tables: 2, 4, 6 and 8.<br>
The output will be shown on the screen.

If you put other numbers in the array, those tables will be written to the screen.<br> 
So you do not know in advance how many numbers there are in the array, nor which numbers.


### Exercise 4 
Copy the following array into a javascript file:<br>
var games = ['Monopoly', 'Yathzee', 'Bridge', 'Poker', 'Pesten', 'Mens erger je niet', 'Cluedo'];

Make sure that every time you enter the page, 1 of the games is shown randomly.
