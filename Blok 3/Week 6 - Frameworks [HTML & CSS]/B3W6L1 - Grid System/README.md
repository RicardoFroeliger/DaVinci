# B3W6L1 - Grid System
## Created by Ricardo Froeliger

You were able to read in the theory how bootstrap works with the grid system and how it deals with responsiveness on different devices.

In this lab you will get started with making a small website responsive with Bootstrap.<br>
You will use the supplied website (lab1_Bootstrap.zip) for this.<br>
You can only change the code in index.html for this lab.<br>
In this html you only link your bootstrap and you can only add Bootstrap classes in the html code.<br>
You don't create new elements, and the order leaves you the same.

**NOTE: You do NOT have to write css during this lab.**

### Requirements:
Make sure you have worked out the following requirements per screen size in this lab.

* Extra small:<br>
    All elements are below each other and fill the entire page width small.<br>
    The red element (1) and the orange element (2) take up the whole width.<br>
    Of the yellow elements (3-*) there are always 2 next to each other (so you get 3 rows of 2).<br>

    The red element (1) and the orange element (2) take up the whole width.<br>
    Of the yellow elements (3-*) there are always 3 next to each other (so you get 2 rows of 3).<br>
