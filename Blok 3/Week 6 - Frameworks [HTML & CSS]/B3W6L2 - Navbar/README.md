## Created by Ricardo Froeliger

Create an HTML page, remember that it must be responsive.<br>
Now link this page to Bootstrap via CDN by clicking [here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.2/getting-started/download):

### Requirements
* Create a menu in your HTML code, don't use classes yet.
* Use the navbar class.<br>
    This is one of the default elements of Bootstrap.<br>
    This makes a navigation element that is responsive.
* Add a small piece of our own (custom) css.<br> 
    (this is to show that you can also add your own style)<br>
    (Don't forget to link your own css to your HTML page)
* On a small screen your menu should be able to expand and collapse.<br>
    On a big screen your menu is always collapsed are there is no button to expand.
