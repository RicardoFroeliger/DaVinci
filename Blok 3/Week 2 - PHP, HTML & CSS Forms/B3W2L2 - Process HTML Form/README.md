## Created by Ricardo Froeliger

1. Create a php page called that processes the data entered from the form at lab 1 via a GET request.

    The result you should see is as follows:

    * H1 heading: "The data entered are:"
    * Below that "Name:" followed by the name entered in the input by name
    * Below that "Email address:" followed by the e-mail address entered in the input for email

2. Adjust the code so that the form is processed via a POST request.
